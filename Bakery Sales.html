									<h3 class="major">The Process</h3>
									<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Bakery/bakery-products.jpg" alt="" /></span>This was a simple project due to the dataset being easy to use. I got this dataset from kaggle.com which has a bunch more.
										I started off by importing the table which came as an excel csv file from kaggle into MySQL, then I checked that the datatypes were according to what I wanted. The dataset initially had 234005 entries, over 136000 transactions and 6 columns.The dataset provides the daily transaction details
										of customers from 2021-01-01 to 2022-09-30.

									<h4 class="major">MySQL</h4>
									<p> I got this dataset from kaggle.com which had the objective to forecast the sales in 
										order to ease the production planning.
										So I started off by importing the table which came as an excel csv file from kaggle, into Mysql,
										after checking that the datatypes were according to what i wanted. the dataset had a initial total
										of 234005 rows by 6 columns.
										<br><br>
										Cleaning the data
										<br>
										My first task was to check for duplicates as this was a large dataset and all was good
										as it turned out no duplicates came out.
										The dataset came with a column called myunknowncolumn which numbered the rows in a 
										confusing way so I had to create a column called count to auto increment and count the
										rows.Then renamed the date(datetime) column to date_ordered with date datatype.
										The time column came as text so I renamed the time(datetime) column to time_ordered
										with time datatype.
										<br>
										Then I renamed the article column to product_ordered which was better to me.
										The unit_price column came with the pound sign attached to each price. In order
										to make visualiztion better for me I removed the pound sign and renamed the column to
										unit_price_euro. I also changed the format from '1,95' to '1.95'.
										<br>
										After all these I checked for null or blank cells in the table and there were none.
										The product_ordered column had rows with '.' as entry so I removed those rows as it
										wasn't necessary to keep which may or may not have affected my visualization.
										The quantity column came with negative values for ordered products so for better
										visualiztion I removed them, then removed rows where the unit_price was 0.
										
										Finally I dropped the column called myunknowncolumn which I didn't need.

									<br>
									<br>

									<h4 class="major">Tableau visaulization</h4>
									<p>After I was satisfied with my SQL codes and ouput, I imported the data into Tableau for
										visualization. It took me a while to get the correct visualizations I needed. I had to combine and test
										all the columns against each other before I could get good visualizations that were okay with me. 
										</p>

										<h4>Dashboard 1</h4>
										<p>The dashboard visualization 1 starts with the count of each products sold for the years
											2021 and 2022 at the top left. It shows the Traditional Baguette as the most popular product sold
											for both years with the highest count of products, followed by Coupe product.</p>

										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Bakery/Dashboard 1.png" alt="" /></span></div>

										<p>The second visualiztion at top right shows  the yearly count of products per year and
											month. We can see that the order of products keeps rising with a dip around June,
											but then a huge rise in products sold during August, signifying their busiest month.
											immediately we are followed by a drop as the year comes to an end. The data doesn't show 
											us why but its something we can observe for the year 2021 and 2022. 
										</p>
										<p>Next at the bottom left we have the product performance by days of the week.
											This visuals shows us Wednesday is a not so busy day and Sunday is the busiest day 
											probably because its a no work day for other workers. While other days have fairly the same
											level of activity but we see a rise over the weekend (Saturdays and Sundays).
										</p>
										<p>At the bottom right we see the performance of each product on different weekdays
											with the Traditional Baguette outshining the others on all days and on Sunday too,
											the busiest day.
										</p>
	
										<h4>Dashboard 2</h4>

										<p>For Dashboard 2, at the top we have the yearly count of products by
											weekdays in a general outlook.</p>
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Bakery/Dashboard 2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									
										<p>At the bottom left we have the count of products with respect to the time there were 
											ordered and as we can see, the activity keeps rising over the hours with peak activity 
											close to midday at 11 and then a serious drop in activity after lunch at 14-15:00 hrs
											we then see a short rise again at 16-18 hrs.</p>

										<p>The last visual at the bottom left shows us the line chart of products and the time
											there were ordered again with the Traditional Baguette beating other products at all
											times of day.</p>

										<h4>Advice On Production Planning</h4> 
										<p>
											- The Traditional Baguette is the most popular product, so it can be adviced to always 
											have the ingredients necessary to make it in bulk followed by the Croupe.
											
											<br>
											
											- We see that within 10-12:00 hours are the busiest so products should be ready before then.
											<br>
											
											- Wednesdays aren't so busy so workload can reduce and products made on that day be less.
											<br>
											
											- Saturdays & Sundays have increased activity so a full house should be present with all workers.
											<br>
											
											- July and August are the busiest months of the year so those months should be
											fully stocked on ingredients for each products especially the Traditional Baguette.
											<br>
											
											
											Note : 2022 data ends in september thats why the yearly count of products by year and month ends
											in September.</p>

										<p>This was a fun project to work on both in cleaning up the data in SQL and visualizing
											in tableau.</p>
