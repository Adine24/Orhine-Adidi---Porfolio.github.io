								<h2>Diabetes Outcome Analysis</h2>
								<p>This Project tackles the positive or negative outcome of diabetes with regards to the different factors. I was able to analyze this data with the use of MySQL and Tableau.</p>

									<h3 class="major">The Process</h3>
									<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/diabetes.jpg" alt="" /></span>This turned out to be a simple project due to the dataset being easy to use. I would have done this in excel but I decided to use MySQL to brush up on my skills there. I got this dataset from kaggle.com which has a bunch more.
										I started off by importing the table which came as an excel csv file from kaggle, into MySQL, then I checked that the datatypes were according to what I wanted. The dataset had a total of 768 rows by 10 columns.</p>

									<br>
									<br>
						
									<h4 class="major">MySQL</h4>
									<p> The dataset had NO NUll values or Blank cells so there was little to no cleaning of the data.
										The outcome for diabetes came in integer datatype as 0s and 1s for output,
										so I created a new column called diabetes_outcome with varchar datatype and equated it to
										the outcome column, signifying that 0 means No and 1 means Yes for diabetes.
										
										After that I ordered the table by age,glucose,bloodpressure etc for a better understanding
										when I want to visualize.
										</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Adine24/Data-Analysis---Portfolio/blob/main/Diabetes.sql">You can see the full code here</a>

									<br>
									<br>

									<h4 class="major">Tableau visaulization</h4>
									<p>After I was satisfied with my SQL codes and ouput, I imported the data into Tableau for
										visualization. It took me a while to get the correct visualizations I needed. I had to combine and test
										all the columns against each other before I could get good visualizations that were okay with me. 
										Age and glucose column turned out to be the most common factor I used when visualizing.</p>

										<h4>Dashboard 1 and 2</h4>
										<p>The visuals starts with the average measures(Glucose, Insulin, BMI, Skinthickness) shown as 
											values and in a bar chart</p>
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Diabetes/Dashboard 1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
	
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Diabetes/Dashboard 2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									
										<h4>Visualization 1 - Amount of glucose by age with diabetes_outcome as a measure </h4>
										<p>Read details below</p>
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Diabetes/Sheet 1 .png" alt="" /></span></div>
										
										<h4>Visualization 1 continued</h4>
										<p>This visualization shows the average glucose in different age groups and whether or not 
											they had diabetes and obviously as it turned out, age wasn't a facotor if they had diabetes or 
											not. Rather the average amount of glucose was a factor. but the average amount glucose wasnt 
											determined by the age. For example a 32 year old with average glucose of 128.9 and a 42 year old
											with average glucose of 127.3 both had and diabetes_outcome of 1(yes) indicating that the less or
											or more glucose someone had with respect to their age wasnt the only factor for one getting
											diabetes.</p>
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Diabetes/Sheet 1.1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										
										<h4>Visualization 2 - Average BMI(Body Mass Index),SkinThickness by Age with diabetes_outcome and 
											DiabetesPedigreeFunction(DPF) as a measure</h4>
										<p>This visualization had me looking at if BMI or SkinThickness had a play in getting diabetes
											or not. As you move along the chart the average BMI, SkinThickness and DPF varies with respect to
											different ages. This showed me that it wasnt about the individuals BMI or SkinThickness 
											or their age.</p>
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Diabetes/Sheet 2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										
										<h4>Visualization 3 - Average Glucose, Insulin by Age with DPF as Intensity and diabetes_outcome, 
											DiabetesPedigreeFunction(DPF) as a measure</h4>
										<p>With this visualization I checked for average Glucose,Insulin with respect to Age and used
											DPF to Intensify the diabetes_outcome for yes and no results whcih are the areas with thick lines. 
											<br>
											<br>
											It turned out this way:
											<br>
											- Age wasnt a factor to getting diabetes.
											<br>
											- diabetes_outcome turned out yes,when the average glucose was high.
											<br>
											- diabetes_outcome turned out yes,when the average insulin was high but with the dataset
											 not always with different ages.
											 <br>
											- diabetes_outcome turned out yes,when the intensity was high.
											<br>
											
											-- This signifies that the outcome for diabetes will be yes when all three measures are high.</p>
										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Diabetes/Sheet 3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										
										<h4>Visualization 4 - Average Glucose, Insulin by Pregnancies with DPF as intensity and diabetes_outcome, 
											DiabetesPedigreeFunction as a measure</h4>
										<p>This last sheet had me looking at if pregnancies had a factor to play in diabetes or not
											looking at the graph it shows that an individuals number of pregnancies didn't matter. Rather
											still the average glucose and insulin with the intensity of DPF was the determining factor to
											havin a diabetes_outcome of yes.
											<br>
											<br>
											Therefore in conclusion :
											<br>
											- Control your glucose intake.
											<br>
											- Control your insulin levels if possible.
											<br>
											- Check your DiabetesPedigreeFunction and seek advice on what to do.</p>

										<p>The visualizations also came out simplified but it was a nice and cool project to work on. <br>
											Thank you for viewing till the end.</p>
